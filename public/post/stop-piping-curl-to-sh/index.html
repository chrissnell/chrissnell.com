			      <p>I&rsquo;ve noticed a trend lately where software developers ask you to pipe the output of a HTTP GET to a shell to install their software. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s certainly convenient for the inexperienced shell user who might not be comfortable with Apt or Homebrew; never mind that we spent the late 1990s and 2000s building these tools that make it easy to install software! &nbsp;The pipe-to-shell method is definitely the new hotness but this idiotic method has been around for a while. &nbsp; When I was a clueless freshman at Vanderbilt in 1993, I used this technique install an IRC client on a SunOS machine in the computer lab like a total noob:</p>


 telnet sci.dixie.edu 1 | sh 


<p>At the time, I had no idea what that command did and I happily ran it. &nbsp; Did it install a backdoor into my account on the VUSE systems? &nbsp;Maybe. &nbsp;It would have been ridiculously easy for the Dixie admins to do that. &nbsp; It was a pretty spiffy shar(1) archive that packaged up some binaries and shell scripts in a uuencoded shell package. &nbsp;All I knew is I ran that command and a bunch of shit scrolled across my screen for a few minutes and when it was done, I had an IRC client and I was happy. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Sure, you could fetch the URL in your browser first and review the shell script but will most people do this? &nbsp; How good are you at quickly reading a shell script? &nbsp; Could you spot a well-hidden backdoor, a little bit of obfuscation tucked away in the middle of a huge regex?</p>

<p>The pipe-to-shell technique is showing up more and more these days. &nbsp;RVM uses it&hellip;</p>

<p>pip uses a variation of this&ndash;only slightly less degenerate&ndash;where they ask you to download and execute some Python&hellip;</p>

<p>To be fair, pip is also available through popular package managers but they&rsquo;re still pushing this method first to new users.</p>

<p>Why are we doing this? &nbsp;It&rsquo;s terrible from both security and maintainability perspective. &nbsp; If a committer of one of these popular software packages gets their desktop 0wned, the users of their software might very well get rootkits installed on their servers without their knownlege.</p>

<p>What&rsquo;s so wrong with good old apt and yum? &nbsp;Unlike the pipe-to-shell method, these repositories have measures in place to authenticate packages and the very nature of a package allows the sysadmin to cleanly uninstall it at a later date.</p>

<p>Please stop piping curl(1) to sh(1) before it really <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nG-4p4Er3VY">becomes a thing</a>.</p>
